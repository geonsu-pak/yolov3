> The object detection problem = a regression problem  
> The image is divided into an S Ã— S grid  
> If the center of a target falls into a grid, the grid is responsible for detecting the target.

Each grid will output the followings:  
> bounding box : x,y,w,h -> (x,y) is the center of box   
> confidence : IoU score between the predict box and the real box  
> class probalitity : object classification score
